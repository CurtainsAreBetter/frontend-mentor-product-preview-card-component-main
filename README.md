## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Media Query

### What I learned

Through this project I gained a better understanding of the box model, css flexbox, and rem. While I am likely not following best practices, my css organization is also improving.

### Continued development

I still have a long way to go when it comes to writing good semantic HTML. With time and a few larger projects, I'll hopefully feel more comfortable with my semantic decisions.

### Useful resources

- [Flexbox reference](https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/a-guide-to-flexbox/) - A good visual reference for flexbox. I used this and the mdn periodically.
- [Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/27177161/flexbox-curved-corners) - Helped with curving the image corners as flex-items.

[100 Devs with Leon Noel](https://leonnoel.com/100devs/)
I am currently watching the youtube videos from Leon's bootcamp and this has given me a comfortable foundation in both html and css. I highly recommend having a look if you want to become a full stack developer and don't know where to start.
